        <p>
          1 Hearken, O ye people of my church, saith the voice of him who dwells
          on high, and whose eyes are upon all men; yea, verily I say: Hearken
          ye people from afar; and ye that are upon the islands of the sea,
          listen together.

        <h2>Alma 32:16</h2>
        <p>
          16 Therefore, blessed are they who humble themselves without being
          compelled to be humble; or rather, in other words, blessed is he that
          believeth in the word of God, and is baptized without stubbornness of
          heart, yea, without being brought to know the word, or even compelled
          to know, before they will believe.
